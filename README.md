# ECE250: Signals & Systems

## About ECE250

**[ECE250: *Signals & Systems*](http://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=ECE250)** is a 2xx-level course offered to undergrads pursuing the CSAI and ECE disciplines at IIIT-Delhi. The course centers around exposing students to the concepts of signals, transforms, and their applications. It aims to:

- introduce students to discrete-time and continuous-time [signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal)
- enable students to represent signals as [Fourier series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series)
- enable students to analyze signals using [Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform), [Laplace transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_transform), and [Z-Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-transform)

This repository contains the solutions to all (programming) assignments given in the duration of the course.

The solutions have been written using matplotlib on google collaboratory
